# Bikesharing
## Purpose
There is an interest to create a bike sharing business in Des Moines. However, before starting the business proposal, data would need to be presented to potential investors to show that there is profitability and sustainability with the business. With the data provided from a successful bike sharing program in New York by the name of CitiBike, multiple data visualizations could be created to illustrate how the same business could be implemented in Des Moines. With the use of Tableau, interactive data visualizations were created that show a wide range of biking rental statistics. 
## Results
To interact with the data visualizations created, please view the [link to the Tableau story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thomas.chin4347/viz/Module14Challenge_16683760808430/BikesharingStory?publish=yes "link to dashboard")

The visualization above illustrates the number of bike users that checkout within a two hour time frame of checking in. As seen in the image, a majority of bike users check out within an hour of checking in. 
![Gender Breakdown.png](https://github.com/tommy-chin/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Gender%20Breakdown.png)
The visualization above illustrates the gender breakdown of the data. A majority of bikers are male while the next majority are females and then followed by unknown.

The visualization above illustrates the number of bike users that check out within a two hour time frame of checking in but with a gender filter being applied. As seen in the image, all of the genders listed generally checkout within an hour of checking in. 
![August Peak Hours.png](https://github.com/tommy-chin/bikesharing/blob/main/images/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)
The visualization above illustrates a horizontal bar graph that shows the number of bike users checking in during all hours of the day in August. A majority of bikers check in between the times of 16:00 to 19:00 and 08:00. 
![Trips by Weekday per Hour.png](https://github.com/tommy-chin/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)
The visualization above illustrates a heat map of the number of bikers that start biking at certain times of the day and the days of the week. A majority of bikers seem to start biking on Thursdays from 5pm and 6pm. 
![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour).png](https://github.com/tommy-chin/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)
The visualization above illustrates a heat map of the number of bikers that start biking at certain times of the day and the days of the week. A gender filter is applied to this heat map. Despite there being a lower amount of bikers for the female and unknown genders, the heat maps seem to follow the same trend as the male gender heat map. 
![User Trips by Gender by Weekday.png](https://github.com/tommy-chin/bikesharing/blob/main/images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)
The visualization above illustrates a heat map of the number of bikers that decide to bike during different days of the week. A gender filter and a usertype filter is applied. The two possible usertypes are normal customers and subscribers to CitiBike. A majority of the bikers in this data set are subscribers to CitiBike.  

## Summary
From the data gathered and put into visualizations, a couple conclusions could be drawn that could help influence the business proposal for a bike sharing business in Des Moines. Since a majority of bikers start biking rentals after 06:00, it is recommended that any bike repairs be done between the hours of 00:00 to 05:00. Although males seem to make up the majority of bikers, all genders typically bike around the same times and days of the week. With that being said, Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays seem to have the highest amount of biking rentals so it is recommended there be enough bikes and advertisements during those days. CitiBike has a subscription model with their bike rental that seems to be popular since a majority of their bike rentals are from subscribers to their business. A subscription service would be recommended for the potential bike sharing business in Des Moines. Two more visualizations could be made to provide further insight on the business proposal for Des Moines. A data visualzation could be made illustrating the user types in relation to trip durations. This would provide insight onto whether customers or subscribers have longer or shorter trips. Another data visualization would be the user types in relation to gender. This could give insight onto which genders are more likely to become subscribers to the bike sharing business.
